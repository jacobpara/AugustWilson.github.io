        <h2>Freedom Corner</h2>
        <p>Freedom Corner stands today as a poignant testament to the resilience and collective spirit of the Hill District community. Located at the intersection of Center and Crawford streets, this monument holds profound significance as a symbol of resistance against urban renewal and a beacon of hope for social justice. Designed by architect Howard Graves, a native of the Hill District, Freedom Corner overlooks the once-vibrant Lower Hill, now a somber reminder of broken promises and displaced communities. With its floor crafted from opaque black stone from Zimbabwe, symbolizing the African heritage of many residents, and adorned with concentric rings bearing the names of fallen heroes and living advocates of civil rights, the monument serves as a perpetual tribute to those who dared to challenge the status quo. Dedicated on April 23rd, 2001, after two years of fundraising efforts led by Councilman Sala Udin, Freedom Corner embodies the enduring legacy of struggle and solidarity in the pursuit of justice.</p>

<p>The genesis of Freedom Corner traces back to the early 1960s, when James McCoy, former chair of the NAACP labor and industry committee, christened the site to galvanize the community's resistance against encroaching urban development. Named strategically, the designation of 'Freedom Corner' served not only as a physical marker but also as a rallying cry for the preservation of the Hill District's identity amidst the expansion of the Civic Arena. McCoy, alongside Frankie Pace, orchestrated protests in 1968 to oppose the further advancement of the arena into the Hill, anchoring their struggle in the broader context of the national Civil Rights movement. Backed by St. Benedict the Moor church, a steadfast supporter providing hospitality and sustenance to protestors, Freedom Corner became a focal point for dissent, symbolizing the collective determination to safeguard the community's rights and heritage. Thus, the naming of Freedom Corner not only imbued the site with symbolic significance but also strengthened the resolve of the Hill District residents to assert their voice and preserve their neighborhood's integrity.</p>

        <p>-named Freedom Corner by James McCoy in early 60s. Some sociological studies say that naming something helps create a ‘shared reality’…in other words, naming this place the Freedom Corner basically strengthened the idea among the people of having a base from which to make their voice heard… 
Note…James McCoy is former chair of NAACP labor and industry committee</p>

<p>-James McCoy and Frankie Pace organized protests in 1968 in response to the Civic Arena development expanding further up the Hill</p>  

<p>-Some strategic merit in its naming…the name ‘freedom’ ties the struggles of the Hill District against urban renewal to the larger national Civil Rights movement. </p> 

 	<p>-Located on the corner of Center and Crawford, where residents of the Hill District protested the ongoing urban renewal of the 60s. The monument was designed by architect Howard Graves, native of the Hill District</p>
 	
 	<p>-Overlooks the Lower Hill, which was once filled with markets, nightclubs, religious places, etc. Torn down to construct Civic Arena in 1956 with the promise of better housing. When the housing didn’t materialize, people protested with the signs seen on the left picture in the previous slide. Homes up to Crawford street were razed to the ground.</p>
 	
 	<p>-Councilman Sala Udin spent 2 years raising funds for the monument before its grand opening on April 23rd, 2001. A computer will be installed behind the wall that says ‘Freedom Corner’, for people to learn more about local civil rights leaders (is it there yet?)</p>
 	
 	<p>-The floor is made up of an opaque black stone from Zimbabwe, symbolizing the ancestry of many black Hill residents from Africa. Surrounded by 2 rings of engraved stones…the inner ring has the names of 25 fallen heroes who fought for civil rights, and the outer ring, which is being added onto, has over 70 names of people who were alive and fighting for justice and civil rights, at least as of 2001</p>

<p>-The protests were backed by St Benedict the Moor church…it provided hospitality and food for protestors. 3 other churches in the Lower Hill were torn down during redevelopment…St Benedict the Church enlarged its congregation to include the members of the destroyed churches…it serves as a reminder for the scars of urban renewal.</p>
