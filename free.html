        <h2>Freedom Corner</h2>
         <p>-named Freedom Corner by James McCoy in early 60s. Some sociological studies say that naming something helps create a ‘shared reality’…in other words, naming this place the Freedom Corner basically strengthened the idea among the people of having a base from which to make their voice heard… 
Note…James McCoy is former chair of NAACP labor and industry committee</p>

<p>-James McCoy and Frankie Pace organized protests in 1968 in response to the Civic Arena development expanding further up the Hill</p>  

<p>-Some strategic merit in its naming…the name ‘freedom’ ties the struggles of the Hill District against urban renewal to the larger national Civil Rights movement. </p> 

 	<p>-Located on the corner of Center and Crawford, where residents of the Hill District protested the ongoing urban renewal of the 60s. The monument was designed by architect Howard Graves, native of the Hill District</p>
 	
 	<p>-Overlooks the Lower Hill, which was once filled with markets, nightclubs, religious places, etc. Torn down to construct Civic Arena in 1956 with the promise of better housing. When the housing didn’t materialize, people protested with the signs seen on the left picture in the previous slide. Homes up to Crawford street were razed to the ground.</p>
 	
 	<p>-Councilman Sala Udin spent 2 years raising funds for the monument before its grand opening on April 23rd, 2001. A computer will be installed behind the wall that says ‘Freedom Corner’, for people to learn more about local civil rights leaders (is it there yet?)</p>
 	
 	<p>-The floor is made up of an opaque black stone from Zimbabwe, symbolizing the ancestry of many black Hill residents from Africa. Surrounded by 2 rings of engraved stones…the inner ring has the names of 25 fallen heroes who fought for civil rights, and the outer ring, which is being added onto, has over 70 names of people who were alive and fighting for justice and civil rights, at least as of 2001</p>

<p>-The protests were backed by St Benedict the Moor church…it provided hospitality and food for protestors. 3 other churches in the Lower Hill were torn down during redevelopment…St Benedict the Church enlarged its congregation to include the members of the destroyed churches…it serves as a reminder for the scars of urban renewal.</p>
