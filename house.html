        <h1>August Wilson's House</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="container">
        <p>“…and I have a fierce affection for the Hill District and the people who raised me.” – August Wilson 
<p>Standing proudly at 1727 Bedford Avenue, the August Wilson House, run by the Daisy Wilson Artist Community nonprofit organization, commemorates the life and work of one of Pittsburgh’s prodigies – the playwright August Wilson.
<p>August recalled his childhood with nostalgia. “… As a family, we did things together. … We all sat down and had dinner at a certain time. … We didn’t have a TV, so we listened to the radio.”

	<h3>Childhood Home</h3>
<p>August Wilson was born and raised by Daisy Wilson at 1727 Bedford Avenue. The apartment complex was multiethnic, with Black, Jewish, and Italian families living in the complex - a microcosm of the neighborhood as a whole. Bella’s Market was owned by a Jewish family, and two Italian brothers repaired watches and shoes next door to him. Occasionally, their kids played with Daisy’s.
<p>1 of 6 children, he had to share a room with all of his siblings in the cramped apartment. However, he wasn’t inside often, and he’d play outside, letting his imagination lead the way. Strong-willed and resourceful, Daisy Wilson taught her children to read, with August being the first. Eventually, she was able to get 2 rooms above them from a family that moved out.
<p>August Wilson passed away in 2005, and the house was purchased the same year by Paul Ellis Jr for $25,000, with the intention to renovate it. 
-He referred to it as ‘sacred ground’.

<h3>House In Ruins</h3>

<p>Many years ago (the year exact year is unknown), Anthony Chisholm, actor in 58 August Wilson productions, visited the playwright. On a tour of the home, and Chisholm took pictures that are now unfortunately lost. “It was a raggedy old house. It was covered in ivy”, Anthony Chisholm would later say. 
<p>August Wilson last visited his childhood home in 1999, when the house was in decay. Boarded up, the house was crumbling, and windows were rotting. It was unfit for living.

<h3>Restoration and Revival</h3>

<p>Denzel Washington led efforts to fund the restoration along with several others (listed below). Originally projected to be $4-5 million, the estimate went up to $7 million, due to supply chain issues caused by the pandemic. 

<p>In 2011, basic maintenance work was done – walls and flooring were shored up – in order to keep the building standing. By 2016, further support for walls and upper floors, as well as beautifying the brick exterior.
<p>Finally, on August 14, 2022, the House was officially ready to open. Denzel Washington helped with the groundbreaking ceremony, officially opening the house to the Hill. In his words, “He [August Wilson] is yours, and you are his. You just share him with the rest of us.”

<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>Every year there is a Block Party, on April 27th, August Wilson’s birthday. The whole community gets together in a vibrant celebration to share food and drinks, enjoy various artistic performances, and just catch up. Outside is a renovated backyard with a stage on which a play from Wilson’s Century Cycle is performed every year. 

<p>But August Wilson never wanted a museum or mausoleum…he didn’t care much about being celebrated: he wanted his house to be useful to others. To inspire artists by giving them the tools and space to create. And to this end, the House is equipped with studios and hosts writers workshops, helping practicing artists while introducing others to the power of art. A true celebration of Wilson’s legacy.
