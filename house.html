  <p>
<h3>August Wilson’s House now</h3>
-Standing proudly at 1727 Bedford Avenue, the August Wilson House, run by the Daisy Wilson Artist Community nonprofit organization, commemorates the life and work of one of Pittsburgh’s prodigies – the playwright August Wilson.
<br>-On the first floor to the left of the lobby is Bella’s Market Gallery, named in honor of the grocery store of the family lived in the apartment complex during August’s childhood. It currently hosts paintings from various artists inspired by August Wilson, and also serves a ‘meeting’ room and performance space. 2 steps below the lobby, it is intimate, but geared to foster community.
<br>-On the second floor, the original 2 rooms, 1 bed and 1 kitchen, are on display, giving visitors a glimpse into the childhood of August Wilson. This space was shared among Daisy Wilson and her 6 kids, of whom August was 1.
<br>-Multiple artist studios and spaces throughout the building.
<br>-Outside is a renovated backyard with a stage on which a play from Wilson’s Century Cycle is performed every year. The pathway into the house is made up of Legacy Bricks engraved with the names of donors
</p>
<p>
<h3>History of the House</h3>
-Multiethnic, with Black, Jewish, and Italian families living in the complex…a microcosm of the neighborhood.
<br>-August Wilson, born in 1945, spent his first 13 years there
<br>-Bella’s Market in the front, and two Italian brothers repaired watches and shoes next door to him
<br>-Considering that 6 kids shared a small space, the inside was often very cramped. However, they would play outside in the backyard and let their imaginations run wild.
<br>-August recalls his childhood with nostalgia. “… As a family, we did things together. … We all sat down and had dinner at a certain time. … We didn’t have a TV, so we listened to the radio.”
<br>-Eventually, Daisy Wilson was able to get 2 rooms above them from a family that moved out.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Decay of the House</h3>
-August Wilson last visited in 1999, the house was in decay. The house, boarded up and unsuitable for living, was crumbling, and windows were rotting.
<br>-Many years ago (unknown what year but before 2005), Anthony Chisholm, actor in 58 August Wilson productions, visited the playwright. Wilson took Chisholm on a tour of the home, and Chisholm took pictures that are now lost.  
<br>-“It was a raggedy old house. It was covered in ivy” – Anthony Chisholm
</p>
<p>
<h3>Restoration Process</h3>
-Purchased in 2005 by Paul Ellis Jr for $25,000, with the intention to renovate it. He referred to it as ‘sacred ground’
<br>-Denzel Washington led efforts to fund the restoration, and Tyler Perry, Oprah, Samuel and LaTanya Jackson, Laurence Fishburne, Shonda Rhimes, Antoine Fuqua, John McClain, contributed, along with Richard King Mellon and Hillman Foundations, and several others chipped in.
<br>-Originally projected to be $4-5 million, but during the dwindle of the pandemic the estimate went up to $7 million, due to supply chain issues
<br>-In 2011, basic maintenance work was done – walls and flooring were shored up – in order to keep the building standing. By 2016, further support for walls and upper floors, as well as beautifying the brick exterior. 
</p>
<p>
<h3>Revival</h3>
-On August 14, 2022 Denzel Washington helped with the groundbreaking ceremony, officially opening the house to the Hill. In his words, “He [August Wilson] is yours, and you are his. You just share him with the rest of us.” 
<br>-Denise Turner is the current acting Chief Executive. Dr Christopher Rawson, play critic and close friend of August Wilson, also serves on the Board of Directors.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Mission of the House</h3>
-To inspire artists by giving them the tools and space to create. That’s what the studios and workshops are for…August Wilson didn’t want a Museum…he wanted his house to be useful to others. 
<br>-Every year there is a Block Party, on April 27th, August Wilson’s birthday. The whole community gets together in a vibrant celebration to share food and drinks, enjoy various artistic performances, and just catch up
