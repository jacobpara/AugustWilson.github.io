<h3>August Wilson and the Grill</h3>
-One night, August Wilson was walking down Center Avenue, and saw hordes of people gathering around the grill, peering through a window into the classy interiors of the Crawford Grill
<br><br>
-Wilson, hearing the music, joined them, and was mesmerized by the magic of John Coltrane. An important moment in his life, as it opened him up to Jazz
<br><br>
-He was, in his own words, “stunned into silence by the power of art and the soaring music of John Coltrane and his exploration of man’s connection to the divinity. And the power of possibility of human life.”
<br><br>
-His love of the Blues and Jazz informed his writing, influencing the music he’d pick for his plays. But more importantly, it informed his style of writing, and his dialogues and monologues seem to have a sort of ‘rounded, meandering’ rhythm so present in the music that inspired it.
<br><br>
-One of his plays, Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, was about the power of the Blues, as well as the exploitation of Black musical artists.

<p>
<h3>The Hill and the Grill</h3>
-Gave the Hill District the moniker ‘Crossroads of the World’ due to the many jazz players passing through and important people like Martin Luther King visiting this place
<br><br>
-Jazz legends such as Lena Horne and Billy Eckstine played here
<br><br>
-A place of relative racial integration in a time of racial segregation. White people who lived Downtown would flock to the Grill, and people of all races would bond over their love of Jazz, without any kind of hatred or animosity. It was like a shelter from the outside world. 
<br><br>
-Recognized as a landmark by the state of Pennsylvania in 2001
<br><br>
-Closed due to sewage and roofing problems in 2003
<br><br>
-Purchased by former Pittsburgh Steelers player Franco Harris in 2010, who unfortunately passed away in 2022. He had a passion for music 
<br><br>
-Plans were revealed to reopen it as a jazz club, with a space for up-and-coming musical artists to practice. 
</p>

<p>
<h3>The Grill’s Glimmer of Hope</h3>
-Building remains closed and under renovation for now.
<br><br>
-“Crawford Grill is a monument. Thank God they’re going to save it”…Dwayne Dolphin, former Crawford Grill musician
