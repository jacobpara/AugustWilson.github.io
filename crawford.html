        <h2>Crawford Grill</h2>
        <p>-mixed audience…highlight this…highlight that the Crawford Grill was a place where people of different cultural, social, and economic backgrounds could get along.</p>

<p>-ran from 1943-2003</p>

<p>-the first one, located somewhere else, was burned in 1957</p>

<p>-A popular place to  hear the Blues, an expression of the Black experience in an age when no explicit expression of such experience was even tolerated? Look at what August Wilson thought about the blues</p>
<p>
-Questions for Dok Harris (son of Franco Harris, who bought the Grill in 2010)
1. What were the challenges of renovating the Crawford Grill and bring it back to life? Why was it delayed for so long?
2. Why do you think that the city didn’t invest in the Grill? To me the Grill seems like a gold mine, so I was wondering why they didn’t invest in it sooner…do you think you could speak to that a little?
</p>
<p>-Also use the Grill to paint the picture of the Hill thriving</p>

<p>-why was it located in the Hill?Look into Gus Greenlee</p>
