    </header>
    <div class="container">
<p>-4 wallpaper stores in the community…shows that the Hill was thriving (this detail, along with a few others I’ll have to research, helps to paint a picture of the Hill). Even when people were poor, they cared about decorating their homes.</p>


<p>-Shop ‘n Save opened in 2013, closed in 2019.</p> 
<p>-before that, food desert for 30 years</p>

<p>-try to identify Abdullah Salem’s ties to the Hill…try to be more specific</p>

	    
        <h2>Mainway Supermarket</h2>
	     <p>	-Opened in 1954 and ran for 14 years, until it was closed in 1968 after being burned due to the riots. Was located on Center Avenue </p>
 	
 	 <p>-Family owned, started by 4 brothers  </p>
 	
 	 <p>-Hill District has been declared a ‘food desert’ ever since, with people having to travel outside the Hill for groceries  </p>

		<h2>Salem's</h2>
	     <p>  	-When Shop ‘n Save closed in 2019, the lot was purchased by Abdullah Salem, owner of Salem’s, for $1.9 million</p>
 	
 	<p>-Shop ‘n Save closed down due to maintenance and lack of profitability</p>
 	
 	<p>-65 employees, all living in the Hill</p>
 	
 	<p>-Operational, but the whole store (which includes a restaurant) will have a grand opening in April</p>
