        <h2>1839 Wylie Avenue</h2>
        <p>1839 Wylie Avenue is the address of the fictional Aunt Ester’s house in August Wilson’s Century Cycle. The character of Aunt Ester is draped in mystique. 366 years old (as of King Hedley II, the play in which she dies), her name is a play on the word ‘ancestor’, representing the heritage of August Wilson and African Americans across all eras in the United States. </p>
<p>But in reality? 1839 Wylie Avenue is an empty plot, with the exception of a red door. </p>
<p>The number 1839 is no coincidence though…it is the year of the Amistad Revolt, when slaves were held captive over the La Amistad slave ship. The theme of death on the slave ships is central to the plot of Gem of the Ocean. The red door on the other hand represents a connection and heritage August Wilson had to the continent of Africa through his ancestors. </p>
<p>On August 24, 2019, that empty land was used for a production of the same play by the Pittsburgh Playwrights Theater Company. Quite unusual, considering its proximity to the road and the noisy cars. But that was the point – to juxtapose the old setting of the Hill District in 1904 with the modern day, which I believe reinforced August Wilson’s point about how people cannot – and should not – escape their heritage. This was a struggle for Harmond Wilks, protagonist in August Wilson’s Radio Golf, as he, campaigning to be Pittsburgh’s first Black mayor, considers tearing down Aunt Ester’s now-abandoned home in favor of an apartment complex and parking lot. Ultimately, Harmond sees the history of Aunt Ester’s home in the Hill, and effectively throws away his campaign to preserve the House. </p> 
<p>One of the challenges of the set was to build it, and seating for audience, on the Hill…though they were able to open on time, they had to scrap audience preview shows due to the 1-week delay. But they got it done. It was intended to be in cooperation with the Hill District, and local vendors set up food stalls just outside the venue, sweetening the deal for everyone involved. </p>
