        <h2>1839 Wylie Avenue</h2>
        <p>-more emphasis on Harmond Wilks and Aunt Ester’s House in the play Radio Golf</p>

<p>-the play is a story of gentrification…what is Harmond Wilk’s role in this? Maybe he is a representative of the idea that future generations have a tendency to erase their heritage, and must make a conscious effort to recognize it.</p>
<p>-Why is the door red? It reflects his connection with the Yoruba religion, and his consciousness of his ancestry extending to Africa…this ancestry was important in Gem Of The Ocean</p>

 	<p>-Aunt Ester’s House is a fictional building that is the home to Aunt Ester, a fictional character that has lived 366 years, eventually passing away in King Hedley II</p>
 	
 	<p>-Aunt Ester is a play on the word ‘ancestor’, and the character basically represents the wisdom of the ancestors throughout August Wilson’s work.</p>
 	
 	<p>-In Radio Golf, the building is set to be demolished, with an apartment complex and parking lot using some of its land…but at the last scene, Harmond decides to drop out of the race for mayor, and paint the House, symbolizing an act of resistance against the plans for development which would erase centuries of history and culture from the Hill District</p>
 	
 	<p>-The plot on 1839 Wylie is currently empty, except for a red door, symbolizing Aunt Ester’s house, which had a red door as indicated in Gem of the Ocean. In my understanding the red door is a sole remainder of the set of the play put on by the Pittsburgh Playwrights Theater Company in 2019. They chose to build it on the empty lot to create a contrast between the old time and the modern day, which I think symbolizes the permanence of the heritage of the African ancestors that AAunt Ester represents.</p>
