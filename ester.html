        <h2>1839 Wylie Avenue</h2>
        <p>
In August Wilson's theatrical realm, the address 1839 Wylie Avenue carries profound symbolic weight, serving as a nexus of cultural heritage and ancestral wisdom. Central to this significance is the iconic red door, a tangible representation of Aunt Ester's House, a fictional yet spiritually resonant abode within Wilson's oeuvre. Across several of Wilson's plays, most notably "Radio Golf," Aunt Ester's house stands as a beacon of communal memory and ancestral connection amidst the encroaching tide of gentrification. The red door, steeped in symbolism, reflects protagonist Harmond Wilks' deep-rooted ties to his African ancestry and the Yoruba religion, mirroring the enduring resilience of the Hill District's cultural identity in the face of urban development.</p>

<p>The Pittsburgh Playwrights Theater Company's decision to construct the set of "Gem of the Ocean" on the vacant lot at 1839 Wylie Avenue represents a bold artistic endeavor fraught with logistical challenges. Inspired by Wilson's rich tapestry of characters and settings, the endeavor aimed to bring the vibrant world of Aunt Ester's House to life within the very heart of the Hill District. However, the practicalities of building and maintaining such a set posed significant hurdles, requiring meticulous planning and resourcefulness from the theater company. Despite these challenges, the endeavor ultimately succeeded in creating a tangible link between the theatrical realm and the lived experience of the community, forging a powerful connection between art and reality.</p>

<p>Beyond its artistic ambitions, the production of "Gem of the Ocean" served as a unifying force, bringing together diverse communities in celebration of August Wilson's enduring legacy. Through the transformative power of theater, audiences were invited to immerse themselves in the rich tapestry of African-American history and culture, fostering a sense of collective resonance and shared heritage. In this way, the play transcended its role as mere entertainment, becoming a catalyst for dialogue, reflection, and community engagement. Through the collaborative efforts of artists, performers, and audience members alike, "Gem of the Ocean" exemplified the profound capacity of art to inspire, educate, and unite across boundaries of time and space.

        <p>-more emphasis on Harmond Wilks and Aunt Ester’s House in the play Radio Golf</p>

<p>-the play is a story of gentrification…what is Harmond Wilk’s role in this? Maybe he is a representative of the idea that future generations have a tendency to erase their heritage, and must make a conscious effort to recognize it,</p>
<p>-Why is the door red? It reflects his connection with the Yoruba religion, and his consciousness of his ancestry extending to Africa…this ancestry was important in Gem Of The Ocean</p>

 	<p>-Aunt Ester’s House is a fictional building that is the home to Aunt Ester, a fictional character that has lived 366 years, eventually passing away in King Hedley II</p>
 	
 	<p>-Aunt Ester is a play on the word ‘ancestor’, and the character basically represents the wisdom of the ancestors throughout August Wilson’s work.</p>
 	
 	<p>-In Radio Golf, the building is set to be demolished, with an apartment complex and parking lot using some of its land…but at the last scene, Harmond decides to drop out of the race for mayor, and paint the House, symbolizing an act of resistance against the plans for development which would erase centuries of history and culture from the Hill District</p>
 	
 	<p>-The plot on 1839 Wylie is currently empty, except for a red door, symbolizing Aunt Ester’s house, which had a red door as indicated in Gem of the Ocean. In my understanding the red door is a sole remainder of the set of the play put on by the Pittsburgh Playwrights Theater Company in 2019. They chose to build it on the empty lot to create a contrast between the old time and the modern day, which I think symbolizes the permanence of the heritage of the African ancestors that AAunt Ester represents.</p>
